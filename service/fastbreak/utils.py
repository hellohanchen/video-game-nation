def build_fb_collections(ts_provider, plays, player_ids):
    """
        Builds a collection of plays for NBA players or teams, given a dictionary of play IDs and their sets with
        the lowest serial number of each set.

        Args:
            plays: A dictionary where keys are play IDs and values are the number of times the play was performed.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing two elements: a dictionary of player IDs mapped to dictionaries of their play statistics,
            and a list of play IDs that were not found in the TS_ENRICHED_PLAYS dictionary.

        Raises:
            None.

        This function iterates through a dictionary of play IDs and their counts, and computes statistics for each NBA
        player or team based on the plays they were involved in. If a play ID cannot be found in the TS_ENRICHED_PLAYS
        dictionary, it is added to the not_found_plays list.

        The function returns a tuple containing two elements: a dictionary of player IDs mapped to dictionaries of
        their play statistics, and a list of play IDs that were not found in the TS_ENRICHED_PLAYS dictionary.
        If a play corresponds to an NBA player, the play statistics are added to the player's dictionary in the
        player_collections dictionary. If a play corresponds to a team, the team statistics are added to the team's
        dictionary in the team_collections dictionary. Note that the team collections part of the function is not
        implemented yet.
