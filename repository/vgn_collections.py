        Builds a collection of plays for NBA players or teams, given a dictionary of play IDs and their counts.

        player or team based on the plays they were involved in. If a play ID cannot be found in the TS_ENRICHED_PLAYS
        dictionary, it is added to the not_found_plays list.

        their play statistics, and a list of play IDs that were not found in the TS_ENRICHED_PLAYS dictionary.
        If a play corresponds to an NBA player, the play statistics are added to the player's dictionary in the
        player_collections dictionary. If a play corresponds to a team, the team statistics are added to the team's
        dictionary in the team_collections dictionary. Note that the team collections part of the function is not
